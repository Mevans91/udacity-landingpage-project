# udacity-landingpage-project
A landing page with a navbar created dynamically using only javascript, with 3 sections
prepared for demonstration purposes. The navbar self updates as you add more sections, with
a convenient button that generates new sections. Each section also becomes active when in view.
This was done as a project for my online class through Udacity.
